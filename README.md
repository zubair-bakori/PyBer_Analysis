# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
   -  The purpose of this analysis is to see how weekly fares of Pyber ride-sharing vehicles differ between urban, suburban and rural locations to serve as basis for decision           making by company management

## Results
   -	As expected urban and suburban rides brought in the highest income conversely, they had the much lower average fares
   -	The rural rides are the lowest in number but had the highest average weekly fare

## Summary
   - Our recommendations are:
   - Pyber should consider increasing the number of vehicles plying the rural and suburban locations
   - Slightly raise the faes in the urban and suburban locations
   - Study the trend for another 6-12 months then take the decision(s)
